The wxPython GUI has been created using wxFormBuilder v3.3 beta.
To alter it, install wxFormBuilder and open sakura_gui.fbp, make your modifications and save the .fbp file then hit F8 to generate a new version of sakura_gui_autogenerated.py, which is written to the directory above this one. Any new event handlers will need to be overridden in the SakuraBaseMainFrame() class in sakura_ui.py.
